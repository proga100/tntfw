Easily select CSS Ready Classes for your fields within Gravity Forms

== Description ==

> This plugin is an add-on for the amazing Gravity Forms Plugin. 
Special thanks to Brad Vincent and Bryan Willis for developing the first and revised version of this plugin. 

Gravity Forms has CSS Ready Classes to style your form fields. Using these classes, you can easily create more advanced layouts for the fields in your forms. Excellent idea, however, the problem is you always need to remember what the exact class name is. Now with this CSS Ready Classes selector, you donâ€™t need to remember. Simply click on a button to launch the pop-up and choose the class you want to add.

= Features =
* Convenient button added under the advanced tab next to the CSS Class field
* Clean and simple pop-up that lists all the CSS Ready Classes
* Add more than one CSS Ready Class
* Double-click a CSS Ready Class to add it and auto-close the popup
* Also 4 columns supported

== Installation ==

1. Upload the plugin folder to your `/wp-content/plugins/` folder
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Make sure you also have Gravity Forms activated.
