*Please note you will need the following plugins installed to completely automate the collection of contracts using Gravity Forms and WP E-Signature.*
1. [Gravity Forms](http://aprv.me/1TAspLi)
2. [WP E-Signature](http://aprv.me/2lfrDYG) (Ultimate, Business or Pro license)
3. [Stand Alone Document](http://aprv.me/2lOBqBk) (comes with above licenses)

*An Ultimate, Business or Pro license license is required and can be purchased at [www.approveme.com](http://aprv.me/2lOpn7l)


**What would you do if you found out the contracts you use to run and operate your business were not legally binding?**


What if you and your client were in a courtroom only to find out that the digital signature used on your contract was not signed with a compliant esignature application? 

**The legal industry is a highly regulated industry that has strict laws and regulations around the electronic signature and digital signature submission process.**    


= How is this Signature Add-On different than the Gravity Forms Signature Add-on by Rocket Genius? =  

WordPress Form Plugins like Gravity Forms are absolutely fantastic! You can create some amazing and incredible WordPress workflows using their powerful WordPress Forms plugin; However, *signing a legally binding contract is NOT Gravity Forms main focus* (it is WP E-Signature’s SOLE focus). We have spent years developing a platform that adheres to the strict [UETA and ESIGN](https://www.approveme.com/ueta-and-esign-act?utm_source=wprepo&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=gravityforms) national and international document signing guidelines.

Most WordPress contract plugins and signature addons out there are not legally binding let alone UETA/ESIGN compliant (they do not adhere to the strict laws and regulations in the document singing industry). These typical signature add-ons, only “capture signature information as it is drawn and sends data to your web server where this information is converted into a PNG image and stored on your server.”

This method, exposes you and your signers legal signature on the ftp server where your WordPress website lives. **In other words the png files most signature add-ons generate, of your client’s hand drawn legal signature (the same signature which is used to buy a house, apply for a credit card, take out a business loan) is available to ANY ftp intruder; putting both you and your signer at high risk for identity theft.**

This Signature Plugin fills in the gap by making the esignature process compliant with UETA/ESIGN regulations.

**The new signature add-on by [Approve Me](http://www.secure.approveme.com/demo/gravity-forms-demo/?utm_source=wprepo&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=gravityforms) is the bridge between a form generation plugin and having a UETA / ESIGN compliant document signing application that lives on your WordPress website.**

Watch the video above to see how you can save time and money by completely automating contracts for your web design, photography, consulting or freelance business using our **Gravity Forms Digital Signature Add-On**.


WP E-Signature by ApproveMe focuses 100% on legally binding contract signing (UETA & ESIGN compliant). No monthly fees. So you can use your website to sign contracts. It is by far the most customizable document singing application built for WordPress.

ApproveMe’s WordPress Contract Plugin WP E-Signature adhere’s to the strictest electronic signature and digital signature regulations by encrypting, storing, and protecting your data in such in a way that is damn near difficult to retrieve from a database let alone manipulate a contract.

If the validity of a signature were to ever get questioned in a court room you would have peace of mind knowing that both you and your signer are protected by the ApproveMe verified seal.

If you’re wanting even more out of WP E-Signature, we have it! There are TONS of advanced features available for our business license holders. Our WordPress Contract Plugin is by far the easiest way to integrate a court recognized Gravity Forms Approval process into your WordPress website.

**The *Gravity Forms* Signature Add-On by [Approve Me](http://www.secure.approveme.com/demo/gravity-forms-demo/?utm_source=wprepo&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=gravityforms) allows you to capture court recognized signatures immediately after a user submits a Gravity Form by either emailing or redirecting the users that recently filled out your gravityform to a unique contract or agreement made specific for that user, requiring them to draw (or type) their electronic signature using a touchscreen device, touch pads or even a mouse.**

*With [WP-E Signature](https://www.approveme.com/?utm_source=wprepo&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=gravityforms) (ultimate, business or pro license) and this Digital Signature for GravityForms plugin you can automatically generate a contract for your customers to sign based on their form results from a Gravity Form.*

**That’s just the start. Once customers sign…**

*…you and the customer will automatically receive a PDF of their signed contract.*

*…no need to register on an outside website (all signatures happen without leaving your site)*

*… you’ll have a 100% legally compliant signature on file to protect you AND the customer (according to UETA/ESIGN guidelines).*

###This Digital Signature add-on transforms your WordPress website into a court-recognized document signing application (but without the monthly fees... and with unlimited users).###
 
* Perfect for those wanting to automate the collection of signatures on proposals, estimates, timesheets, terms of service agreements, new client contracts, waiver forms and more!

Automatically require your WordPress visitors to sign a legally binding agreement after submitting a gravity form.

Quickly and easily add court recognized contract signing capabilities into your WordPress website using this Gravity Forms addon and ApproveMe’s WP E-Signature (business license). Gone are the days of sending your signers to an unrelated third party website just so they can sign your web design, photography, consulting or freelance contract. The form submitter will never have to leave your website or heaven forbid install any special browser plugins, add-ons or extensions to sign your contract.

With ApproveMe’s WP E-Signature and their new Gravity Forms Signature Add-On you can create a legally binding contract that is tailored 100% to the user that just submitted your Form.

**Do the smart thing.  Don’t get caught in a courtroom with a document that’s not legally binding.**

**Transform one single page of your existing WordPress website into a secure document and electronic signature application.  WP Digital E-Signature by ApproveMe, is a legally binding Wordpress Contract Plugin, that’s easy to use.**

WP E-Signature has a very extensive eSignature premium add-on library with dozens of expandable and customizable [eSignature automations](https://www.approveme.com/esign-features/?utm_source=wprepo&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=gravityforms) and [third-party integrations](https://www.approveme.com/esign-features/?utm_source=wprepo&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=gravityforms) to further enhance your custom document signing needs.

The Signature Add-On works on all major desktop and mobile browsers. This includes IE, FireFox, Safari, Chrome, Opera, iOS, Android, and WebOS.

In additional to being incredibly easy to use, ApproveMe’s Gravity Forms WordPress Signature Plugin can automatically insert data that was submitted from a Gravity Form into a UETA/ESIGN compliant and court recognized contract using your very own WordPress website.

So if you have a dropdown menu in your Gravity Form called “Web Design Package” and you offer a few different packages (each with a different price point) you can easily create a contract that includes the package details of an order in the contract that gets sent to your Gravity Form end-user.

WP E-Signature is significantly different than the current signature add-on offered by Gravity Forms as it gives Gravity users the power (and leverage) to host their own document signing application that hooks into Gravity Form results and triggers on-demand legal contracts (that are compliant with all the document signing esignature laws and regulations).

**Automatically Trigger Contracts To Be Sent** Once a user submits a gravity form you can automatically trigger a Contract to either be sent via email or to be the very next page the Gravity Form Submitter sees when they submit their form.

**Connect Gravity Forms With Wp E-Signature** This Gravity Forms Digital Signature Add-on will combine the powerful features of gravity forms with the relentless fury of features from WP E-Signature.

**Add Gravity Form Field Values Into A Wp E-Signature Contract** With WP E-Signature’s Gravity Forms Electronic Signature Add-On you can easily insert submitted form results into a contract that gets triggered automatically once a user completes a Gravity Form submission.

**Redirect User To Wp E-Signature Contract After Gravity Form Submission** Once a user successfully completes a Gravity Form Submission they are automatically redirected the contract of your choice using this premium E-Signature add-on.

**Email A User A Contract Once They Fill Out A Gravity Form** After successful form submission you can choose to email the form submitter (or another user if the other users email and name was in the gravity form that was just completed).

**Signing Reminder Emails** If a user has not yet signed the agreement that you were requiring them to sign after submitting your gravity form, you can automatically activate signing reminder emails where you can choose the trigger date, the frequency of reminder emails, and the expiration date of the signing reminder emails.

If you do business online, customers probably have to sign an agreement or an online contract. Problem is a paper agreement doesn’t hold up if your business is an online business and your customers are online customers.

###How it Works:###

**[Try Gravity Forms Signature Demo Here](http://www.secure.approveme.com/demo/?utm_source=wprepo&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=gravityforms)**


*Gravity Forms Signature plugin is incredibly easy to setup. Once you have a valid ApproveMe business license you can easily (and automatically) generate a legally binding (court recognized) contract using submitted GravityForm data and require your Gravity Form submitter sign your WordPress contract.*

This plugin is fantastic for Freelancers, Web Designers, Photographers and Small Business owners that are looking to streamline their contract creation process.

###Follow these easy Gravity Forms Digital Signature Plugin steps to get started###

**Step 1:**
ApproveMe's WP E-Signature requires a few more plugins/add-ons so you can unlock the power and automate Gravity Forms and legally binding Digital Signatures. You'll need to download the following:

*Please note you will need the following plugins installed to completely automate the collection of contracts using Gravity Forms and WP E-Signature.*

1. [Gravity Forms](http://aprv.me/1TAspLi)
2. [WP E-Signature](http://aprv.me/2lfrDYG) (Ultimate, Business or Pro license)
3. [Stand Alone Document](http://aprv.me/2lOBqBk) (comes with above licenses)

*An Ultimate, Business or Pro license license is required and can be purchased at [www.approveme.com](http://aprv.me/2lOpn7l)

**Step 2:**
*Enter your ApproveMe license*
Once you have purchased a business license from ApproveMe you will need to enter your license key to activate updates and support.

To download your license key you can log into your [ApproveMe account](https://www.approveme.com/purchase-history?utm_source=wprepo&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=gravityforms) here (password was emailed with your receipt)

**Step 3:**
*Create a blank WordPress page*
After the ApproveMe plugins are installed and your settings saved you will need to create a blank/empty WordPress page for each Stand Alone Document (or agreement) that you will be creating.

To learn about Stand Alone Documents you can visit this [helpful article](https://www.approveme.com/wp-digital-signature-plugin-docs/faq/basic-document-vs-stand-alone-document/?utm_source=wprepo&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=gravityforms)

**Step 4:**
*Create a Stand Alone Document*
Ok you're doing great! You're almost there... now that you've created a blank WordPress page we need to create a Stand Alone Document and then attach that WordPress page to our Stand Alone Document.

To learn more about Stand Alone Documents checkout the [documentation page](https://www.approveme.com/wp-digital-signature-plugin-docs/article/stand-alone-documents-add-on/?utm_source=wprepo&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=gravityforms) for this add-on.

**Step 5:**
*(optional) Insert Gravity Form User Data into a Contract*

This step will vary based on your desired outcome. Digital signature by Approve Me is triggered when a Gravity Form is submitted. This add-on gives you the ability to integrate Gravity Form user data (that was inputted from the user when the form was submitted) into a new contract that will either be emailed to the user or will be displayed to the user after they submit you form.

To insert data into a Gravity Form, you will need the [Custom Fields](https://www.approveme.com/downloads/signer-input-fields/?utm_source=wprepo&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=gravityforms) feature enabled by ApproveMe (it’s included with your license).

**How to add form fields data into a contract using Gravity Forms**

Navigate to the Signer Input Fields/Custom Fields icon and select "Gravity Form Data".

Select the Gravity Form that you have already created (and would like to connect to your contract) using the dropdown menu.
Choose the field data that you would like to insert into your new contract.

A shortcode will be generated with this information. Don't worry though, the actual field value that your user enters will be displayed in its place once they signing your contract.

This is an example of the auto-generated shortcode that will get inserted into the document you are creating after you select your desired field data from your Gravity Form. 

[esiggravity formid="3" field_id="1" ]

You can move the shortcode that gets generated automatically, anywhere in your contract and it will display the user's submitted data wherever you have the shortcode located in your contract.

**Step 6:**
*Choose your document options and save settings*

After you have entered all of your desired contract text and have connected your desired Gravity Forms field results to your Stand Alone Document, you are ready to choose/define your document options.

Please Note: Before you can publish your contract, you will also need to connect your Stand Alone Document with the blank WordPress page you created earlier for your contract. You can do so by searching for and selecting the page from the "Display on this page" dropdown menu located under the "Document Options" section.

**Step 7:**
*Almost there... you're 50% complete*
Once you've published your Stand Alone Document you are 50% complete. The next step is you will need to choose your "trigger" and "action" options for this document in gravity forms.

Click LET'S GO NOW! to define those last Gravity Form settings.

**Step 8:**
*Finish setting up the Gravity Form workflow/trigger*

You're so close to being finished! Now you just need to choose your contract and the your desired actions for when this workflow is triggered.

Navigate to the "Forms" tab found in the WordPress dashboard.

Choose the form that you attached the Stand Alone Document.

Select the "WP E-Signature" option found in the form settings and define the remainder settings.

That's it!

== Frequently Asked Questions ==


= Can I collect legally binding court recognized contracts from my WordPress website after someone submits a Gravity Form? =

With the Gravity Forms Signature Add-on by ApproveMe, along with a [WP E-Signature](https://www.approveme.com/?utm_source=wprepo&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=gravityforms) business license you can easily collect [UETA/ESIGN compliant](https://www.approveme.com/ueta-and-esign-act?utm_source=wprepo&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=gravityforms) signatures from your visitors after they submit a Gravity Form on your website.

**You can even pass details from the submitted Gravity Form into your WordPress contract.**

= Are Digital Signature Legal? =

Yes, electronic digital signatures are legally binding in the United States and many countries around the world.  **United States** in the US there are two digital signature Acts that established the legality of digital signatures in the US – the [Electronic Signatures in Global and National Commerce Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_Signatures_in_Global_and_National_Commerce_Act) (ESIGN, 2000) and the [Uniform Electronic Transactions Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform_Electronic_Transactions_Act) (UETA, 1999). Both the ESIGN and UETA establish that electronic records and signatures carry the same weight and legal effect as traditional paper documents and handwritten signatures, they say “A document or signature cannot be denied legal effect or enforceability solely because it is in electronic form.” The ApproveMe WP E-Signature plugin is UETA/ESIGN compliant.

**United Kingdom**
In the UK, similar legislation to the ESIGN Act in the USA was likewise settled in 2000, and is known as the UK Electronic Communication Act. Approve Me is the main WordPress Plugin to Sign Contracts that warrants its eSignature solution to be consistent with this act.

**European Union**
The appropriation of the European Directive 1999/93/EC of 13 December 1999 established a the utilization of electronic marks on electronic and digital contracts inside of the European Union (EU). Thirty European nations (EU-27, Croatia, Turkey and Liechtenstein) have officially adopted Directive 1999/93/EC. To that end Electronic and Digital marks are effectively being used in Europe, and ApproveMe’s compliant WordPress E-Signature plugin is legitimately acceptable and enforceable within the European Union.

= Will I Need to Renew my ApproveMe License? =

Yes you will (unless you have an Ultimate License). Each license key is valid for one calendar year from the purchase date. An active license key is needed for access to automatic/critical updates, plugin support and access to our growing [eSignature add-on library](https://www.approveme.com/esign-features/?utm_source=wprepo&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=gravityforms).

= Where Can I Find My License Key? =

If you’ve already purchased a license key and need to retrieve the license number, you can do that on the [support site here](https://www.approveme.com/profile/) or follow [these detailed steps](https://www.approveme.com/wp-digital-signature-plugin-docs/article/install-and-activate-plugins-extensions/?utm_source=wprepo&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=gravityforms). Once you’ve successfully logged into the support site (using the credentials emailed to you at the time of purchase), your active license key(s) will be listed at the bottom of the page.

= What do I get with my *approve me* business license =

Your business license grants you access to all of our support resources, documentation, product downloads and basic and advanced add-ons like Stand Alone Documents, Document Templates, Unlimited Sender Roles and others, (which are required for this Gravity Forms Wordpress esignature Plugin) for one calendar year from your purchase date.

= How much does it cost to renew my license? =

The Ultimate Plan does not have a renewal cost.  It is a one-time payment for the WP Esignature plugin.  However all other plans have an annual renewal.  Our goal has always been to pull the price back as much as we possibly can so small businesses and freelancers could sign documents electronically using their WordPress website (and save alot of money in the process). Not only is our plugin the most powerful of its kind, it’s also the most affordable.  Not to throw anyone under the bus, but look at what our competitors charge every single year:

Adobe charges $1,080 / yr (per 3 users)
Docusign charges $1,440 / yr (per 3 users)

Not charing for renewals would actually hurt the product as we would not be able to invest as heavily as we currently do back into it...

= What do I get for renewing my license? =

Renewing your license provides an additional year of support and software updates. This provides peace of mind knowing you can turn to us for WP Electronic Signature related support and assistance. You’ll also continue receiving software updates to ensure WordPress compatibility (and security) as well as great new features and enhancements! Also (depending on your license) as we release new basic and premium add-ons you will be able download these at anytime.

= I have other pre-sale questions, can you help? =

Of Course. You’re welcome to ask any question you wish from our [contact form page](https://approveme.com/contact).

**[Try Gravity Forms Signature Demo Here](http://www.secure.approveme.com/demo/?utm_source=wprepo&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=gravityforms)**


[youtube http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpNTG_P7bXY]


*Please note you will need the following plugins installed to completely automate the collection of contracts using Gravity Forms and WP E-Signature.*
1. [Gravity Forms](http://aprv.me/1TAspLi)
2. [WP E-Signature](http://aprv.me/2lfrDYG) (Ultimate, Business or Pro license)
3. [Stand Alone Document](http://aprv.me/2lOBqBk) (comes with above licenses)

*An Ultimate, Business or Pro license license is required and can be purchased at [www.approveme.com](http://aprv.me/2lOpn7l)


**What would you do if you found out the contracts you use to run and operate your business were not legally binding?**


What if you and your client were in a courtroom only to find out that the digital signature used on your contract was not signed with a compliant esignature application? 

**The legal industry is a highly regulated industry that has strict laws and regulations around the electronic signature and digital signature submission process.**    


= How is this Signature Add-On different than the Gravity Forms Signature Add-on by Rocket Genius? =  

WordPress Form Plugins like Gravity Forms are absolutely fantastic! You can create some amazing and incredible WordPress workflows using their powerful WordPress Forms plugin; However, *signing a legally binding contract is NOT Gravity Forms main focus* (it is WP E-Signature’s SOLE focus). We have spent years developing a platform that adheres to the strict [UETA and ESIGN](https://www.approveme.com/ueta-and-esign-act?utm_source=wprepo&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=gravityforms) national and international document signing guidelines.

Most WordPress contract plugins and signature addons out there are not legally binding let alone UETA/ESIGN compliant (they do not adhere to the strict laws and regulations in the document singing industry). These typical signature add-ons, only “capture signature information as it is drawn and sends data to your web server where this information is converted into a PNG image and stored on your server.”

This method, exposes you and your signers legal signature on the ftp server where your WordPress website lives. **In other words the png files most signature add-ons generate, of your client’s hand drawn legal signature (the same signature which is used to buy a house, apply for a credit card, take out a business loan) is available to ANY ftp intruder; putting both you and your signer at high risk for identity theft.**

This Signature Plugin fills in the gap by making the esignature process compliant with UETA/ESIGN regulations.

**The new signature add-on by [Approve Me](http://www.secure.approveme.com/demo/gravity-forms-demo/?utm_source=wprepo&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=gravityforms) is the bridge between a form generation plugin and having a UETA / ESIGN compliant document signing application that lives on your WordPress website.**

Watch the video above to see how you can save time and money by completely automating contracts for your web design, photography, consulting or freelance business using our **Gravity Forms Digital Signature Add-On**.


WP E-Signature by ApproveMe focuses 100% on legally binding contract signing (UETA & ESIGN compliant). No monthly fees. So you can use your website to sign contracts. It is by far the most customizable document singing application built for WordPress.

ApproveMe’s WordPress Contract Plugin WP E-Signature adhere’s to the strictest electronic signature and digital signature regulations by encrypting, storing, and protecting your data in such in a way that is damn near difficult to retrieve from a database let alone manipulate a contract.

If the validity of a signature were to ever get questioned in a court room you would have peace of mind knowing that both you and your signer are protected by the ApproveMe verified seal.

If you’re wanting even more out of WP E-Signature, we have it! There are TONS of advanced features available for our business license holders. Our WordPress Contract Plugin is by far the easiest way to integrate a court recognized Gravity Forms Approval process into your WordPress website.

**The *Gravity Forms* Signature Add-On by [Approve Me](http://www.secure.approveme.com/demo/gravity-forms-demo/?utm_source=wprepo&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=gravityforms) allows you to capture court recognized signatures immediately after a user submits a Gravity Form by either emailing or redirecting the users that recently filled out your gravityform to a unique contract or agreement made specific for that user, requiring them to draw (or type) their electronic signature using a touchscreen device, touch pads or even a mouse.**

*With [WP-E Signature](https://www.approveme.com/?utm_source=wprepo&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=gravityforms) (ultimate, business or pro license) and this Digital Signature for GravityForms plugin you can automatically generate a contract for your customers to sign based on their form results from a Gravity Form.*

**That’s just the start. Once customers sign…**

*…you and the customer will automatically receive a PDF of their signed contract.*

*…no need to register on an outside website (all signatures happen without leaving your site)*

*… you’ll have a 100% legally compliant signature on file to protect you AND the customer (according to UETA/ESIGN guidelines).*

###This Digital Signature add-on transforms your WordPress website into a court-recognized document signing application (but without the monthly fees... and with unlimited users).###
 
* Perfect for those wanting to automate the collection of signatures on proposals, estimates, timesheets, terms of service agreements, new client contracts, waiver forms and more!

Automatically require your WordPress visitors to sign a legally binding agreement after submitting a gravity form.

Quickly and easily add court recognized contract signing capabilities into your WordPress website using this Gravity Forms addon and ApproveMe’s WP E-Signature (business license). Gone are the days of sending your signers to an unrelated third party website just so they can sign your web design, photography, consulting or freelance contract. The form submitter will never have to leave your website or heaven forbid install any special browser plugins, add-ons or extensions to sign your contract.

With ApproveMe’s WP E-Signature and their new Gravity Forms Signature Add-On you can create a legally binding contract that is tailored 100% to the user that just submitted your Form.

**Do the smart thing.  Don’t get caught in a courtroom with a document that’s not legally binding.**

**Transform one single page of your existing WordPress website into a secure document and electronic signature application.  WP Digital E-Signature by ApproveMe, is a legally binding Wordpress Contract Plugin, that’s easy to use.**

WP E-Signature has a very extensive eSignature premium add-on library with dozens of expandable and customizable [eSignature automations](https://www.approveme.com/esign-features/?utm_source=wprepo&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=gravityforms) and [third-party integrations](https://www.approveme.com/esign-features/?utm_source=wprepo&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=gravityforms) to further enhance your custom document signing needs.

The Signature Add-On works on all major desktop and mobile browsers. This includes IE, FireFox, Safari, Chrome, Opera, iOS, Android, and WebOS.

In additional to being incredibly easy to use, ApproveMe’s Gravity Forms WordPress Signature Plugin can automatically insert data that was submitted from a Gravity Form into a UETA/ESIGN compliant and court recognized contract using your very own WordPress website.

So if you have a dropdown menu in your Gravity Form called “Web Design Package” and you offer a few different packages (each with a different price point) you can easily create a contract that includes the package details of an order in the contract that gets sent to your Gravity Form end-user.

WP E-Signature is significantly different than the current signature add-on offered by Gravity Forms as it gives Gravity users the power (and leverage) to host their own document signing application that hooks into Gravity Form results and triggers on-demand legal contracts (that are compliant with all the document signing esignature laws and regulations).

**Automatically Trigger Contracts To Be Sent** Once a user submits a gravity form you can automatically trigger a Contract to either be sent via email or to be the very next page the Gravity Form Submitter sees when they submit their form.

**Connect Gravity Forms With Wp E-Signature** This Gravity Forms Digital Signature Add-on will combine the powerful features of gravity forms with the relentless fury of features from WP E-Signature.

**Add Gravity Form Field Values Into A Wp E-Signature Contract** With WP E-Signature’s Gravity Forms Electronic Signature Add-On you can easily insert submitted form results into a contract that gets triggered automatically once a user completes a Gravity Form submission.

**Redirect User To Wp E-Signature Contract After Gravity Form Submission** Once a user successfully completes a Gravity Form Submission they are automatically redirected the contract of your choice using this premium E-Signature add-on.

**Email A User A Contract Once They Fill Out A Gravity Form** After successful form submission you can choose to email the form submitter (or another user if the other users email and name was in the gravity form that was just completed).

**Signing Reminder Emails** If a user has not yet signed the agreement that you were requiring them to sign after submitting your gravity form, you can automatically activate signing reminder emails where you can choose the trigger date, the frequency of reminder emails, and the expiration date of the signing reminder emails.

= Document Signing Automation =
If you do business online, customers probably have to sign an agreement or an online contract. Problem is a paper agreement doesn’t hold up if your business is an online business and your customers are online customers.

What you need is WP E-Signature. WP E-Signature lets you customize the signing process for what you need with no monthly fees.

###How it Works:###

**[Try Gravity Forms Signature Demo Here](http://www.secure.approveme.com/demo/?utm_source=wprepo&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=gravityforms)**


*Gravity Forms Signature plugin is incredibly easy to setup. Once you have a valid ApproveMe business license you can easily (and automatically) generate a legally binding (court recognized) contract using submitted GravityForm data and require your Gravity Form submitter sign your WordPress contract.*

This plugin is fantastic for Freelancers, Web Designers, Photographers and Small Business owners that are looking to streamline their contract creation process.

###Follow these easy Gravity Forms Digital Signature Plugin steps to get started###

**Step 1:**
ApproveMe's WP E-Signature requires a few more plugins/add-ons so you can unlock the power and automate Gravity Forms and legally binding Digital Signatures. You'll need to download the following:

*Please note you will need the following plugins installed to completely automate the collection of contracts using Gravity Forms and WP E-Signature.*

1. [Gravity Forms](http://aprv.me/1TAspLi)
2. [WP E-Signature](http://aprv.me/2lfrDYG) (Ultimate, Business or Pro license)
3. [Stand Alone Document](http://aprv.me/2lOBqBk) (comes with above licenses)

*An Ultimate, Business or Pro license license is required and can be purchased at [www.approveme.com](http://aprv.me/2lOpn7l)

**Step 2:**
*Enter your ApproveMe license*
Once you have purchased a business license from ApproveMe you will need to enter your license key to activate updates and support.

To download your license key you can log into your [ApproveMe account](https://www.approveme.com/purchase-history?utm_source=wprepo&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=gravityforms) here (password was emailed with your receipt)

**Step 3:**
*Create a blank WordPress page*
After the ApproveMe plugins are installed and your settings saved you will need to create a blank/empty WordPress page for each Stand Alone Document (or agreement) that you will be creating.

To learn about Stand Alone Documents you can visit this [helpful article](https://www.approveme.com/wp-digital-signature-plugin-docs/faq/basic-document-vs-stand-alone-document/?utm_source=wprepo&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=gravityforms)

**Step 4:**
*Create a Stand Alone Document*
Ok you're doing great! You're almost there... now that you've created a blank WordPress page we need to create a Stand Alone Document and then attach that WordPress page to our Stand Alone Document.

To learn more about Stand Alone Documents checkout the [documentation page](https://www.approveme.com/wp-digital-signature-plugin-docs/article/stand-alone-documents-add-on/?utm_source=wprepo&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=gravityforms) for this add-on.

**Step 5:**
*(optional) Insert Gravity Form User Data into a Contract*

This step will vary based on your desired outcome. Digital signature by Approve Me is triggered when a Gravity Form is submitted. This add-on gives you the ability to integrate Gravity Form user data (that was inputted from the user when the form was submitted) into a new contract that will either be emailed to the user or will be displayed to the user after they submit you form.

To insert data into a Gravity Form, you will need the [Custom Fields](https://www.approveme.com/downloads/signer-input-fields/?utm_source=wprepo&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=gravityforms) feature enabled by ApproveMe (it’s included with your license).

**How to add form fields data into a contract using Gravity Forms**

Navigate to the Signer Input Fields/Custom Fields icon and select "Gravity Form Data".

Select the Gravity Form that you have already created (and would like to connect to your contract) using the dropdown menu.
Choose the field data that you would like to insert into your new contract.

A shortcode will be generated with this information. Don't worry though, the actual field value that your user enters will be displayed in its place once they signing your contract.

This is an example of the auto-generated shortcode that will get inserted into the document you are creating after you select your desired field data from your Gravity Form. 

[esiggravity formid="3" field_id="1" ]

You can move the shortcode that gets generated automatically, anywhere in your contract and it will display the user's submitted data wherever you have the shortcode located in your contract.

**Step 6:**
*Choose your document options and save settings*

After you have entered all of your desired contract text and have connected your desired Gravity Forms field results to your Stand Alone Document, you are ready to choose/define your document options.

Please Note: Before you can publish your contract, you will also need to connect your Stand Alone Document with the blank WordPress page you created earlier for your contract. You can do so by searching for and selecting the page from the "Display on this page" dropdown menu located under the "Document Options" section.

**Step 7:**
*Almost there... you're 50% complete*
Once you've published your Stand Alone Document you are 50% complete. The next step is you will need to choose your "trigger" and "action" options for this document in gravity forms.

Click LET'S GO NOW! to define those last Gravity Form settings.

**Step 8:**
*Finish setting up the Gravity Form workflow/trigger*

You're so close to being finished! Now you just need to choose your contract and the your desired actions for when this workflow is triggered.

Navigate to the "Forms" tab found in the WordPress dashboard.

Choose the form that you attached the Stand Alone Document.

Select the "WP E-Signature" option found in the form settings and define the remainder settings.

That's it!

== Frequently Asked Questions ==


= Can I collect legally binding court recognized contracts from my WordPress website after someone submits a Gravity Form? =

With the Gravity Forms Signature Add-on by ApproveMe, along with a [WP E-Signature](https://www.approveme.com/?utm_source=wprepo&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=gravityforms) business license you can easily collect [UETA/ESIGN compliant](https://www.approveme.com/ueta-and-esign-act?utm_source=wprepo&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=gravityforms) signatures from your visitors after they submit a Gravity Form on your website.

**You can even pass details from the submitted Gravity Form into your WordPress contract.**

= Are Digital Signature Legal? =

Yes, electronic digital signatures are legally binding in the United States and many countries around the world.  **United States** in the US there are two digital signature Acts that established the legality of digital signatures in the US – the [Electronic Signatures in Global and National Commerce Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_Signatures_in_Global_and_National_Commerce_Act) (ESIGN, 2000) and the [Uniform Electronic Transactions Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform_Electronic_Transactions_Act) (UETA, 1999). Both the ESIGN and UETA establish that electronic records and signatures carry the same weight and legal effect as traditional paper documents and handwritten signatures, they say “A document or signature cannot be denied legal effect or enforceability solely because it is in electronic form.” The ApproveMe WP E-Signature plugin is UETA/ESIGN compliant.

**United Kingdom**
In the UK, similar legislation to the ESIGN Act in the USA was likewise settled in 2000, and is known as the UK Electronic Communication Act. Approve Me is the main WordPress Plugin to Sign Contracts that warrants its eSignature solution to be consistent with this act.

**European Union**
The appropriation of the European Directive 1999/93/EC of 13 December 1999 established a the utilization of electronic marks on electronic and digital contracts inside of the European Union (EU). Thirty European nations (EU-27, Croatia, Turkey and Liechtenstein) have officially adopted Directive 1999/93/EC. To that end Electronic and Digital marks are effectively being used in Europe, and ApproveMe’s compliant WordPress E-Signature plugin is legitimately acceptable and enforceable within the European Union.

= Will I Need to Renew my ApproveMe License? =

Yes you will (unless you have an Ultimate License). Each license key is valid for one calendar year from the purchase date. An active license key is needed for access to automatic/critical updates, plugin support and access to our growing [eSignature add-on library](https://www.approveme.com/esign-features/?utm_source=wprepo&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=gravityforms).

= Where Can I Find My License Key? =

If you’ve already purchased a license key and need to retrieve the license number, you can do that on the [support site here](https://www.approveme.com/profile/) or follow [these detailed steps](https://www.approveme.com/wp-digital-signature-plugin-docs/article/install-and-activate-plugins-extensions/?utm_source=wprepo&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=gravityforms). Once you’ve successfully logged into the support site (using the credentials emailed to you at the time of purchase), your active license key(s) will be listed at the bottom of the page.

= What do I get with my *approve me* business license =

Your business license grants you access to all of our support resources, documentation, product downloads and basic and advanced add-ons like Stand Alone Documents, Document Templates, Unlimited Sender Roles and others, (which are required for this Gravity Forms Wordpress esignature Plugin) for one calendar year from your purchase date.

= How much does it cost to renew my license? =

The Ultimate Plan does not have a renewal cost.  It is a one-time payment for the WP Esignature plugin.  However all other plans have an annual renewal.  Our goal has always been to pull the price back as much as we possibly can so small businesses and freelancers could sign documents electronically using their WordPress website (and save alot of money in the process). Not only is our plugin the most powerful of its kind, it’s also the most affordable.  Not to throw anyone under the bus, but look at what our competitors charge every single year:

Adobe charges $1,080 / yr (per 3 users)
Docusign charges $1,440 / yr (per 3 users)

Not charing for renewals would actually hurt the product as we would not be able to invest as heavily as we currently do back into it...

= What do I get for renewing my license? =

Renewing your license provides an additional year of support and software updates. This provides peace of mind knowing you can turn to us for WP Electronic Signature related support and assistance. You’ll also continue receiving software updates to ensure WordPress compatibility (and security) as well as great new features and enhancements! Also (depending on your license) as we release new basic and premium add-ons you will be able download these at anytime.

= I have other pre-sale questions, can you help? =

Of Course. You’re welcome to ask any question you wish from our [contact form page](https://approveme.com/contact).

1. **Add New Document:** Once you’ve installed the WP E-Signature, you just need to draft up a new “Stand Alone Document” 

2. **Gravity Form Data** If you click the Signer Input Fields icon you will see the option “Gravity Form Data” you will need to click this in order to connect a gravity Form to this contract.
3. **Select Your GravityForm:** If you already have your gravity form created you can easily insert dynamic field data (from the gravity Form that is being submitted/triggering this contract) by selecting the Gravity Form.
4. **Choose Your Gravity Form Fields:** Once you’ve selected your Gravity Form you will see the available field options from this particular Gravity Form.  You can easily insert the submitted results from your gravity Form in ANY place throughout this contract that you are creating.
5. **Document Signing Options (optional):** WP eSignature by ApproveMe is a powerful eSignature tool filled with LOTS of customizable options i.e. Signing reminder Emails, Attach PDF to emails, Dropbox Sync, Auto Register WordPress Users, and TONS more.  To read all about the available add-on features (which come with the business license) you can checkout: [https://www.approveme.com/wp-esignature-features](https://www.approveme.com/esign-features/?utm_source=wprepo&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=gravityforms)
6. **Connect Your Document to a Page:**Once you have customize your contract to taste you will need to select a BLANK WordPress page to attach this document to.  Do not include this page in your Nav menu since all of the magic actually happens after the Gravity Form is submitted (there’s no need to link to this page because the user will either be emailed a custom link or they will be automatically redirected once the gravity Form is submitted).
7. **Click “LET’S GO NOW”:** After you have published your contract you will need to connect your Stand Alone Document to your Gravity Form.  This is pretty straight forward.  Just click the button “LET’S GO NOW!” to be redirected to the actions/trigger tab for your specific Gravity Form.
8. **Define Your Signing Logic:** This is the page (inside of Gravity Forms) that needs to be customized.  Please choose the Signers Full Name and the Signers Email address along with any other additional/advanced eSignature settings you’d like for your contract.
9. **User Submits a Gravity Form** Once a user submits the Gravity Form that you connected to your WP eSignature contract they will either be redirected to the contract immediately or emailed a invitation to signer their specific/custom contract that includes details from the submitted Gravity Form.
10. **Review & eSign:** Your users will review the contract and add their signature to the contents of the contract.
11. **Select a Digital Signature:**Signers can choose a typed or digital signature 
12. **Agree & eSign:**With their e-signature, the customers agree to the terms of the document
13. **View Signed Document Email:**Customers will be sent an email that includes the link to the document (and PDF if you opt for this method).
14. **Save as PDF:**Customers can either print or download their signed document from the website. To do this, they need to click “View Signed Document” from the link in the email they attained upon signing the document.  With the Attach as PDF add-on install you could also automatically include thee signed contract as a PDF attachment in this email.
15. **WordPress Audit Trail eSignature Certificate:** Proving signer intent is a very important component to signing electronic documents.  Every contract that is signed using WP E-Signature includes a detailed Signature Certificate.
